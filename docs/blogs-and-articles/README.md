## [Consensys Preparing for a Smart Contract Audit](https://media.consensys.net/preparing-for-a-smart-contract-code-audit-83691200cb9c)

If you are planning to launch a project on the Ethereum blockchain, you probably know the importance of a third-party code audit. An external audit can ensure that your contracts function as intended and remove vulnerabilities in the code. Choosing a team of experienced, rigorous auditors is of course essential, but your preparation will also impact the quality of the audit. Some effort on your part will go a long way toward getting you a better, faster audit.

## [How to Prepare for a security review](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2018/04/06/how-to-prepare-for-a-security-audit/)

You’ve just approved a security review of your codebase. Do you:   

* Send a copy of the repository and wait for the report, or   
* Take the extra effort to set the project up for success?   

By the end of the review, the difference between these answers will lead to profoundly disparate results. In the former case, you’ll waste money, lose time, and miss security issues. In the latter case, you’ll reduce your risk, protect your time, and get more valuable security guidance.   

It’s an easy choice, right?   

Glad you agree.   

Now, here’s how to make that security review more effective, valuable, and satisfying for everybody involved.   

## [Report on auditors from SolidStamp](https://www.solidstamp.com/blog/solidstamp-smart-contract-auditor-report-july-2018)

Smart contracts are the heart of the Ethereum blockchain. Every dApp we engage with contains a smart contract created to dictate how it works at the most basic level. It is safe to say we should expect smart contract creators to produce sound and stable smart contracts. But the proverb, trust but verify, exists for a reason. Smart contract auditors are the independent verification mechanism to determine if the intentions and goals of the contract’s creator were rendered into the language of the blockchain. This verification is essential. Because of this importance, we want to shed some light on the organizations doing the audits to verify the integrity of the smart contracts powering the Ethereum blockchain.
